A comprehensive Selenum documentation and example blog.


## Introduction to Selenium Testing

Selenium was created with the intention to automate UI browser testing. 

It contains support for Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and a multitude of other browsers. You can find more information directly from the Selenium site: 

     http://docs.seleniumhq.org/


Challenges this blog will provide solutions for: 

- How to test multiple browser sessions simultaneously
- How to test multiple platforms simultaneously
- How to report test results
- How to create a framework and test library that my coworkers can use  
- How to implement basic "expected" functionality of an automated test suite


## Practical Application of Selenium's Framework


Selenium itself is a very powerful tool, containing very few moving pieces.  However, the solution to automated UI testing does not solely rely on Selenium.  Rather, it combines many tools and frameworks to create an automation orchestration.  

I plan on introducing each piece of my particular solution as separate posts in this blog and include code samples that will help you along your automated test journey. 
   

##  Depth of Knowledge

In this blog, I will be covering the use of tools and frameworks that I have discovered in the short time that I have used Selenium.  We will go over the basics of each tool and how it applies to Selenium. 


Some topics that will be discussed include: 

- Maven project lifecycle (dependency management, test execution, and reporting)
- JUnit (test running, test organization)
- Intermediate Java programming
- Continuous build/integration systems
