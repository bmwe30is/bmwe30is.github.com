## A Brief Introduction to Selenium Testing

Selenium was created with the intention to automate UI browser testing. 

It contains support for Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and a multitude of other browsers. 

I've combined Selenium, JUnit, Maven, and Jenkins to automate full UI testing of my company's UI.  The big picture has been 
to implement automated tests within test suites to perform periodic regression tests of our UI.  

The problem we're trying to address with automation is this: 

- How do we test features and perform regression of a continously changing user interface with changing various back-end services?  

The solution comes to us with scheduled periodic automated testing.  Selenium affords the ability to test multiple browsers and platforms simultaneously.

The aim of this blog is to provide some insight into implementing and deploying a Selenium solution for your various testing needs. 

I plan on introducing each piece of my solution as separate posts in this blog and include code samples that will hopefuly help you along your 
automated test journey.
